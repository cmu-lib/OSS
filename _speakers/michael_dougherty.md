Department Chair, Psychology   
University of Maryland

### Bio

Michael Dougherty is Professor and Chair of the Department of Psychology at the University of Maryland. 
His research focuses on the nexus of decision-making, attention, and memory. 
His non-research time is spent managing the 3rd largest major on campus with a shoestring budget, making lemonade from lemons, convincing faculty that their committee time was well spent, and making ice cream.  
A good day is when his 'research' self meets his 'non-research' self to make data-informed decisions, develop sensible policies, and improve the academic and research culture of his department.
