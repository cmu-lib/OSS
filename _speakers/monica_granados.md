### Bio

Dr. Monica Granados has a PhD in ecology from McGill University.

She has worked on open knowledge initiatives with Mozilla, PREreview and the Government of Canada. 
Monica is now an Assistant Director at Creative Commons working on the Open Climate Campaign promoting open access of climate and biodiversity research.
