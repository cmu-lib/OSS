### Bio

Dr. Sanjiv Singh is an innovator, educator, and entrepreneur. He is currently a Consulting Professor at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, and the CEO of Near Earth Autonomy, a start-up that develops autonomy for next-generation aircraft that will inspect infrastructure, deliver cargo, and transport passengers.

Dr. Singh started his career in 1985, working on the first autonomous ground vehicles to operate outdoors. Since then, he has led research and development efforts with applications in aviation, agriculture, mining, and construction. In 2010 he led a team that demonstrated the first autonomous full-scale helicopter capable of take-off, landing zone evaluation, and safe descent. In 2011 he led the autonomy effort for Transformer, DARPA's flying car program. From 2012-2017, he led the perception efforts for ONRâ€™s AACUS program that demonstrated high-performance autonomous rotorcraft flight in austere environments.  Dr. Singh obtained his Ph.D. in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon in 1995.  He is the founding editor of Field Robotics, a new open-access journal, a TEDx speaker, and a co-founder of four companies.
