### Bio

Stuart King is the Research Culture Manager at [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/about/), an open-access journal that reviews preprints in the life sciences and medicine. Based in Cambridge, UK, his role supports eLife's ambitious agenda to [reform how research is reviewed and communicated](https://elifesciences.org/about/peer-review) and [promote openness, integrity, equity, diversity and inclusion in research and publishing](https://elifesciences.org/about/research-culture). Since 2019, he's been a Steering Committee member for [DORA](https://sfdora.org/), championing responsible research assessment internationally. In his free time, Stuart enjoys pottering around the garden and playing a goblin ranger in a fortnightly D&D game.
