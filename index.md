## Open Science Symposium 2023

We are excited to invite all students, data users, and researchers to join us at the fourth CMU Open Science Symposium, taking place virtually on Zoom. The symposium will build awareness and support for the adoption of open research practices and encourage innovative ideas about data sharing.

The full day program will feature talks from researchers, tool developers, and publishers; panel discussions; and networking opportunities.

This dynamic and interactive symposium will accelerate interdisciplinary collaborations at Carnegie Mellon University and beyond. We look forward to you joining us at this fun and rewarding event!
