## Open Science Symposium 2023

Join us for our signature open science event, a full day of virtual talks and
panels from researchers and thought leaders in academia, industry, and publishing.

The conference will explore how open science is transforming the ways in which 
we do research and share it in a variety of science and non-science disciplines.
Topics will include tenure and promotion policies, rethinking peer review,
lessons from industry, and more!

We will also have the following satellite events this fall:

- *In Conversation with Life Science Researchers: The Evolving Landscape of Data Sharing*, a virtual roundtable, will be held on September 14, 2023.
- *Morning Brew: Exploring Open Science at CMU Libraries*, an informal mixer event, will be held in person on November 8, 2023.
